They are indirectly related to production of goods and services.\r\rHigher costs lead to lower profits and vice versa. Increasing revenue or lowering costs can increase profits. Improving the efficiency of business operations, reducing the cost of material and cutting on labour can reduce costs. The cuts on costs should not cause a drop in business revenue to increase profits. \r\rIf the sales volumes are higher than variable costs, more profits can be generated. Constant sales volume and revenue with reduced costs can increase profits. This course explains the relationship between costs, volumes and profits through cost-volume-profit analysis. \r\rWe show how changes in prices, margins and unit volumes of products or services can affect a company\u2019s ability to generate profits. Cost-volume-profit or CVP analysis is a critical tool for financial analysis that helps businesses determine their ability to become profitable.\r\r<h4>You Will Learn:<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-mod'>\r<li>The definition of the terms: costs, volumes and profits<\/li>\r\r<li>The relationship between costs, volumes and profits<\/li>\r\r<li>How to calculate cost-volume-profit or CVP analysis<\/li>\r\r<li>The assumptions made during CVP analysis<\/li>\r\r<li>How to calculate contribution margin and contribution margin ratio<\/li>\r\r<li>Pound and unit break-even points<\/li>\r\r<li>How to create a contribution margin income statement<\/li>\r\r<li>The benefits of CVP analysis<\/li>\r<\/ul>\r\r<h4>Benefits of the Course:<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-benefit'>\rTaking this course will help you:\r<li>Know the relationship between cost, volume and profits<\/li>\r\r<li>Know how to calculate CVP analysis<\/li>\r\r<li>Know how to use analysis results to increase business profits<\/li>\r\r<li>Know the importance of the relationship of cost, volume and profits in business operations<\/li>\r\r<li>Know the various benefits of CVP analysis in business<\/li>\r\r<li>Learn how to increase profits in your current or future business <\/li>\r\r\r<\/ul>\r"

For many, everyday life can mean spending most days at work, making the need for good hygiene somewhat of a necessity in the workplace. But regardless of whether it is for personal needs or to ensure successful workplace operation, keeping good hygiene is necessary in keeping illnesses at bay.\r\rIt is no hidden fact that many diseases are as a result of poor hygiene. Not only do employers need to provide a clean and healthy work environment for their employees, but individuals must also work alongside their employers to maintain proper individual hygiene as well.\r\rEvery business must adhere to health and safety standards depending on where the business is located. Local laws and regulations provide guidelines for businesses on what level of proper hygiene must be implemented.

This not only helps in confidently supporting a claim but also in achieving the end goal, which is the sole purpose of a project. \r\rA project team and others who are involved in the planning stages should always be kept in the loop in the preparation phase, as they will be able to assist in building a solid successful plan and, ultimately, ensuring a successful project completion. \r\r<h4>What you will Learn in this Course:<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-mod'>\r<li>How to identify what a project is, why it\u2019s being initiated and how to define its purpose<\/li>\r\r<li>How to identify a project\u2019s stakeholders<\/li>\r\r<li>How to identify issues, risks and opportunities <\/li>\r\r<li>The importance of budget estimation and cost management<\/li>\r<\/ul>\r"

Lift trucks (also known as forklifts) are essential to various lines of business.

However, as good and as necessary as lift trucks are, they are large and dangerous pieces of equipment and must be handled properly and safely. If used without authorisation, they can result in fatalities. Not only do business owners and employers need to obtain lift truck licences, but site employees also need to be certified to handle such vehicles.

This way employers can gauge the safety knowledge that a prospective employee has and can train accordingly.\r\rTo learn how to safely work with lift trucks, one should receive a rounded education.

While in some situations, conflicts are harmless, there are other cases where these types of situations can cause tension. Sometimes it is easy to work through these challenging situations, but when things are hard to deal with, it can be useful to access tools that will help defuse the issue. This is where the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) comes into play.\r\rProfessors of management, Ken Thomas, PhD and Ralph Kilmann PhD, created the TKI Conflict Mode Instrument to help with conflict resolution. The TKI works with organisations and individuals to help assess how they deal with conflicts and when\/where they can make changes so that effective resolutions can be made. It can be hard to imagine that every conflict will turn out okay, but with the approach that the TKI Conflict Mode instrument takes, it is possible. Not only can this assist a person in their day-to-day life, but organisations can implement it to encourage a better workflow. By assessing an individual and providing them with an in-depth analysis of how to react to certain conflict situations, this can not only empower an individual to make the right choice, but will also teach them how to handle future, unexpected conflict situations.\r<h4>You Will Learn<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-mod'>\r <li>What the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) is and why it is a useful management tool<\/li>\r <li>How the TKI works and when it can be applied<\/li>\r <li>About the five conflict-handling modes that can be implemented in almost every conflict situation<\/li>\r <li>The benefits of the TKI not just for individuals, but also for members of an organisation<\/li>\r <li>How one can obtain TKI training and certification<\/li>\r<\/ul>\r<h4>Benefits Of Taking this Course<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-benefit'>\r <li>You will learn about the TKI and why it has been such a success with individuals and organisations since being published in the 1970s.

      "courseDescription": "<h4>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy <\/h4>\rPeople with borderline personality disorder struggle with pervasive emotion regulation. They are unable to identify their feelings or emotions, lack the skills they need to manage their emotions and often develop problematic behaviours, such as self-harm, suicidal thoughts and substance abuse to help them cope.\r\rDialectical behaviour therapy was developed to help such people understand the relationship between emotions, thoughts and behaviours. The therapy is based on the notion that changing one of the elements changes the other elements. For instance, changing behaviours also alters related emotions and thoughts, and so on.\r\rDialectical behaviour therapy or DBT differs from other psychotherapy treatments in many ways. It looks at the patient holistically, using a custom approach that meets their treatment needs. It assesses how an individual\u2019s mental health impacts their problem and vice versa. \r\rThis course provides details on everything you need to know about DBT.\r\rFirstly, it defines DBT and how it works to help treat various issues related to mental disorders. \r\rNext, it covers various components of DBT and what is often involved in treatment. \r\rIt goes on to discuss the various DBT treatment modules and their main focus. \r\rFinally, it states the many benefits of dialectical behaviour therapy.\r\r<h4>You Will Learn:<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-mod'>\r<li>The meaning of DBT and how it works<\/li>\r\r<li>The difference between DBT and cognitive behavioural therapy or CBT<\/li>\r\r<li>The components of DBT<\/li>\r\r<li>The treatment modules<\/li>\r\r<li>The mental issues that DBT can treat<\/li>\r\r<li>The benefits of DBT in the treatment of complex mental disorders<\/li>\r<\/ul>\r<h4>Benefits of Taking This Course:<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-benefit'>\rTaking this course can help you:\r<li>Determine if you are suffering from a mental disorder<\/li>\r\r<li>Determine if DBT can help you cope with your emotional issues<\/li>\r\r<li>Learn the benefits of DBT as a form of treatment<\/li>\r\r<li>Learn how to set goals and achieve them<\/li>\r\r<li>Develop healthy relationships<\/li>\r\r<li>Get motivated to take a career in DBT to help people coping with emotional distress<\/li>\r\r<li>Improve your quality of life or that of someone close to you<\/li>\r\r<li>Decide to go for DBT therapy to help you overcome trauma<\/li>\r\r<\/ul>\r"

      "courseDescription": "<h4>Learning Disabilities Awareness<\/h4>\rLearning disabilities are often diagnosed in children after they start school. Although the disorders develop in children at a young age, even before birth, they only manifest in school age children.\r\rAffected children are unable to interpret what they see or hear. They are also not able to connect information from various parts of the brain. The problems manifest as difficulties with written or spoken language, self-control, co-ordination or even attention.\r\rThe difficulties also affect school work and impair learning to write, read or do mathematics. However, an individual\u2019s IQ or the person\u2019s intelligence is not reflected through learning disabilities.\r\rThe disorders are often lifelong, impacting an individual\u2019s family situation, work or school, friendships, daily routines or even play. Overlapping learning disabilities can become apparent in children with the disorders. However, some children have just one independent learning issue, which has no effect on other parts of their lives.\r\rNot all learning difficulties fall under learning disabilities. Some children are just slow to develop specific skills because children naturally differ in their rate of development. Therefore, what may seem to be a learning disorder may just be a delay in reaching maturity.\r\rThis course covers everything you need to know about learning disabilities.\r<h4>You Will Learn:<\/h4>\r<ul class='learn-mod'>\r <li>What learning disabilities are and how they occur<\/li>\r <li>Types of learning disabilities<\/li>\r <li>Signs of learning disabilities in children in their early years, their fifth year and at primary school level<\/li>\r <li>Signs of learning disabilities in secondary school students and adults<\/li>\r <li>Interventions for learning disabilities<\/li>\r <li>Learning disability awareness months and weeks<\/li>\r<\/ul>\r<h4>Benefits of Taking This Course<\/h4>\rTaking this course will help you:\r<ul class='learn-benefit'>\r <li>Understand learning disabilities, how they occur and how they manifest<\/li>\r <li>Learn the different types of learning disabilities<\/li>\r <li>Help create awareness about the learning disabilities<\/li>\r <li>Determine if your child has a learning disability<\/li>\r <li>Learn how to treat learning disorders<\/li>\r<\/ul>"

Play allows them to act out scenes that are similar to what they may be facing, work on addressing particular issues or even develop characters with similar emotions or feelings as theirs. It is a hands-on therapy.\r\rChildren can use toys to express their feelings. For example, a child who has lost a parent or a sibling can use puppets to portray a character that misses a friend and feels sad. A dolls\u2019 house can feature a child beneath their bed, hiding from parents who are fighting, to help a child that has experienced domestic violence.\r\rA therapist can help during play to solve a problem based on the type of approach that is being implemented.
