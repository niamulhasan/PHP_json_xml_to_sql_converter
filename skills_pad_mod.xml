<CourseDescription><h4>Duty of Care</h4> A duty of care is the responsibility to ensure the health, safety and general wellbeing of other people. It can encompass offering constructive feedback and safe working conditions for employees. The UK has a legal obligation for duty of care. People are expected to care about the health and safety of people around them. With such provisions in place, working environments in the UK are most often safe for employees. This is unlike workplace environments in developing countries, as they do not have a legal obligation for duty of care. Employers must first meet legal obligations to be able to offer an advanced duty of care to their employees. They should also determine what their workers need and the duty of care that is already in place in order to help come up with new duty of care principles. Due to the essence of people’s safety at work or anywhere else, this course has been developed to help you understand the term ‘duty of care’ in a general sense, for ease of application in any industry. We start by defining duty of care and what it generally involves. Next, we list the benefits of duty of care to employees and explain whether it is a legal requirement in the UK. Finally, the course covers levels of duty of care and how employers can develop a duty of care policy. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The meaning of duty of care</li> <li>The benefits of duty of care</li> <li>The legality of duty of care</li> <li>Duty of care levels</li> <li>How to develop a duty of care policy </li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of Taking This Course:</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> Taking this course will help you: <li>Understand duty of care and its essence in the workplace or anywhere else where it’s applicable </li> <li>Know the benefits of duty of care to employees</li> <li>Determine if you need duty of care</li> <li>Determine if you have duty of care in place</li> <li>Determine if you have a duty of care to lone workers and people with disabilities</li> <li>Develop an effective duty of care for your working environment</li> </ul> </CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Costs, Volumes and Profits</h4> The difference between business revenue and costs of operation make up business profits. Sales volumes and the cost of products or services can impact the potential of a business to generate profits. This relationship is explained through cost-volume-profit analysis. The difference between sales and variable costs or the cost of goods and/or services sold makes up profits. After deducting fixed costs from the gross profit, you are left with income or the net profit. Fixed costs range from rent and interest to insurance and labour costs. They are indirectly related to production of goods and services. Higher costs lead to lower profits and vice versa. Increasing revenue or lowering costs can increase profits. Improving the efficiency of business operations, reducing the cost of material and cutting on labour can reduce costs. The cuts on costs should not cause a drop in business revenue to increase profits. If the sales volumes are higher than variable costs, more profits can be generated. Constant sales volume and revenue with reduced costs can increase profits. This course explains the relationship between costs, volumes and profits through cost-volume-profit analysis. We show how changes in prices, margins and unit volumes of products or services can affect a company’s ability to generate profits. Cost-volume-profit or CVP analysis is a critical tool for financial analysis that helps businesses determine their ability to become profitable. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The definition of the terms: costs, volumes and profits</li> <li>The relationship between costs, volumes and profits</li> <li>How to calculate cost-volume-profit or CVP analysis</li> <li>The assumptions made during CVP analysis</li> <li>How to calculate contribution margin and contribution margin ratio</li> <li>Pound and unit break-even points</li> <li>How to create a contribution margin income statement</li> <li>The benefits of CVP analysis</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of the Course:</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> Taking this course will help you: <li>Know the relationship between cost, volume and profits</li> <li>Know how to calculate CVP analysis</li> <li>Know how to use analysis results to increase business profits</li> <li>Know the importance of the relationship of cost, volume and profits in business operations</li> <li>Know the various benefits of CVP analysis in business</li> <li>Learn how to increase profits in your current or future business </li> </ul> </CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Project Preparation Certification</h4> Project preparation – a term that may sound self-explanatory – has many obvious and not-so-obvious elements that contribute to its successful implementation. However, before learning what proper project preparation entails, it is important to know what it is and the way in which it is crucial for a successful project outcome. Project preparation, as implied by its name, is the stage of a project whereby all the planning occurs. If you think about important events, such as vacations, a wedding or when buying a home, all require some sort of planning. This is because a planning phase is crucial in many respects but primarily in regards to achieving project goals. Project preparation can include extensive research, preliminary design, developing concepts, identifying operational cost and estimates for capital, as well as sources of funding and consulting stakeholders. It is always a good idea to do as much research as possible in respect of the project and the industries associated with it.

<CourseDescription><h4>Instagram Marketing Certification</h4> The world of marketing changed exponentially with the introduction of social media. Not only did social media platforms allow for a major expansion in marketing demographic outreach, but it introduced an affordable avenue for businesses and companies to market their brand. Since its inception in 2010, Instagram rapidly became a sought-after platform for marketing. As with any form of marketing, Instagram marketing requires research, legwork and a budget. However, the potential to reach the masses is far greater than with any other platform for product marketing, albeit print, digital format or social media. In this Instagram Marketing course, we will look at the brief history of Instagram to gain a better understanding of how the platform works. In addition, we will learn how to effectively use Instagram as a means of domestic and global brand outreach to maximise the potential for success. If used effectively, Instagram marketing may be the only form of marketing that is required for a brand. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The history of Instagram</li> <li>The role that Instagram marketing plays</li> <li>The formula for Instagram’s success</li> <li>Defining business goals</li> <li>Setting marketing objectives</li> <li>How to create a content strategy</li> <li>How to define your target market on Instagram</li> <li>Instagram marketing challenges</li> <li>How to take advantage of Instagram tools</li> </ul> In general, marketing requires a good bit of research. It is important to clearly identify a brand and to market the product/service to the right demographic. Although Instagram is a social media platform, it is not exempt from the rules of efficient marketing. Therefore, to be a successful Instagram marketer or to make sure that the right form of marketing is used for a business, communities and users need to be identified. The latter is particularly important, as it is estimated that 95 million photos and videos are shared via Instagram every day. Therefore, to ensure that a brand is not lost within the sea of many brands and business, the correct target audience needs to be identified.</CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>The Art of Persuasion Certification</h4> The art of persuasion is a difficult one to master but is an invaluable skill to possess. No one wants to be forced to use coercion or aggressive tactics to get their point across or to find common ground on an issue. Persuasion is based on reasoning and understanding rather than hostility or threats, making it the best way to convince your conversation partner that you are right or that your way of doing things is the preferred one. This course goes into detail about how you can develop your own persuasive skills. By practising these skills, you may find that you master the art of persuasion in very little time. We begin by discussing the way human behaviour is often motivated. Next, we move on to discuss Aristotle’s persuasive techniques - ones that are still very relevant today. Finally, we leave you with the steps you should take to ensure that your argument is persuasive. These steps work well in both speech and the written word, making them ideal for essay writers and presenters alike. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The five main influencers of human behaviour and how you should respond to them</li> <li>The four modes of persuasion and how they can be applied today</li> <li>Information on how those persuasive techniques can be used for good or bad intentions </li> <li>How to use Monroe’s Motivated Sequence to your advantage </li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of Taking This Course: </h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>Learning how to become more persuasive in your everyday life without resorting to aggression </li> <li>Being able to participate in more productive conversations</li> <li>Understanding why people tend to display the habits they do</li> <li>Learning how to use simple persuasive techniques in your everyday speech</li> <li>Learning how to construct a persuasive argument in just a few simple steps</li> </ul> </CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Working with Lift Trucks Certification</h4> Many industries depend on lift trucks as they are extremely useful tools in moving heavy materials. Lift trucks (also known as forklifts) are essential to various lines of business. For those who begin working as a lift truck operator, they can go on to become worksite managers, supervisors and trainers. However, as good and as necessary as lift trucks are, they are large and dangerous pieces of equipment and must be handled properly and safely. If used without authorisation, they can result in fatalities. Not only do business owners and employers need to obtain lift truck licences, but site employees also need to be certified to handle such vehicles. Therefore, it is essential for employers to develop and implement training programmes tailored to the job itself. Workers should also look to obtain the proper form of basic training beforehand. This way employers can gauge the safety knowledge that a prospective employee has and can train accordingly. To learn how to safely work with lift trucks, one should receive a rounded education. This should include learning about commonly used lift trucks, how to obtain the necessary training and what can happen if a lift truck is handled without experience. In this course:<strong> </strong> <h4>You Will Learn</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The importance of knowing how to safely operate a lift truck</li> <li>About lift truck training programmes</li> <li>About commonly used lift trucks</li> <li>The dangers of operating a lift truck without authorisation</li> <li>About refresher courses and additional training programmes</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits Of Taking this Course</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>Employers and site personnel will learn about the responsibilities of safely operating a lift truck and the hazards associated with poor handling</li> <li>Learn about safety standards and guidelines and worksite employees will learn how to find the right accredited programme</li> <li>Familiarisation of six commonly used lift trucks, what they are used for and what environments that can be driven in</li> <li>Employers and workers will learn how to avoid dangerous situations with examples of dangerous operation</li> <li>Staff and employers will learn why refresher courses are mandatory and how they can help in meeting safety guidelines</li> </ul></CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument Certification</h4> Conflicts are almost a certainty. While in some situations, conflicts are harmless, there are other cases where these types of situations can cause tension. Sometimes it is easy to work through these challenging situations, but when things are hard to deal with, it can be useful to access tools that will help defuse the issue. This is where the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) comes into play. Professors of management, Ken Thomas, PhD and Ralph Kilmann PhD, created the TKI Conflict Mode Instrument to help with conflict resolution. The TKI works with organisations and individuals to help assess how they deal with conflicts and when/where they can make changes so that effective resolutions can be made. It can be hard to imagine that every conflict will turn out okay, but with the approach that the TKI Conflict Mode instrument takes, it is possible. Not only can this assist a person in their day-to-day life, but organisations can implement it to encourage a better workflow. By assessing an individual and providing them with an in-depth analysis of how to react to certain conflict situations, this can not only empower an individual to make the right choice, but will also teach them how to handle future, unexpected conflict situations. <h4>You Will Learn</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>What the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) is and why it is a useful management tool</li> <li>How the TKI works and when it can be applied</li> <li>About the five conflict-handling modes that can be implemented in almost every conflict situation</li> <li>The benefits of the TKI not just for individuals, but also for members of an organisation</li> <li>How one can obtain TKI training and certification</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits Of Taking this Course</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>You will learn about the TKI and why it has been such a success with individuals and organisations since being published in the 1970s. Additionally, individuals can learn how to implement the results of the assessment test in real-life situations.</li> <li>You will learn about the TKI and how it works to create an in-depth conflict resolution profile for an individual. This profile will essentially indicate how a person should approach each conflict.</li> <li>You will get an understanding of the five conflict-handling modes and will know what situations they should be applied.</li> <li>You will learn what the benefits of TKI training are and why the assessment can help individuals approach conflicts with more acceptance of the situation.</li> <li>You will know how to obtain TKI training and certification and other assessment tests, their benefits, and why using some of them in combination with the TKI can yield even better results.</li> </ul></CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Commitment to Consistency</h4> Many of us are afraid of commitment, regardless of its form. We may hop from job to job (or relationship to relationship), because we are fearful of the unknown. Some people are forever terrified of commitment, which makes them inconsistent throughout their lives. This can cause them to look undependable and untrustworthy to others around them. Consistency is the key to making sure that those around you know that you can be trusted and that you care about them. This course gives you an overview of consistency, why it is important and how commitment is needed to be more consistent. It fully explains what the definitions are for commitment and consistency, why you should be consistent and touches on how to be consistent. The course also gives examples of people who are consistent and committed - you can easily determine how the two are similar and how they work together to make you a better, more respectable person. Finally, the course covers the traits needed to be consistent and committed, some of which overlap. That way, you can see where you stand and can determine how to change so that you have all of those traits (and others) based on your desire to be more consistent in life. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The definition of commitment and consistency</li> <li>How to understand the differences and similarities between the two</li> <li>How to be consistent daily and why you need commitment to do so</li> <li>The traits of being consistent and committed</li> <li>How to become more consistent</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of Taking This Course</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>Learn more about why consistency matters</li> <li>Learn why it’s ok to say no</li> <li>How to be consistent (set goals, schedule time effectively)</li> <li>Learn why you must stay committed to consistency; you don’t just get consistent and never have to work on it again.

Problematic drinking not only affects an individual’s private life, but can also have a detrimental impact on their performance at work.

This means that most organisations will employ workers with problematic drinking habits at some point and it is best to prepare in advance for the possibility that an employee may at some stage require help to overcome their alcohol abuse or addiction. Alcohol abuse is a sensitive subject and employers may feel ill-prepared to approach and assist employees who need help. Fortunately, organisations can learn how to reduce levels of problematic drinking among their employees, offer support to workers who need help controlling their alcohol intake and take steps to create a healthy, safe working environment.

This course will provide you with an introduction to the concept of mental illness, the signs and symptoms of the most common mental illnesses and how mental distress can be successfully managed. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>What is meant by the terms “mental health” and “mental illness”, how psychological distress manifests itself and how mental illness impacts a person’s life.</li> <li>The main symptoms of depression, anxiety disorders and panic attacks.</li> <li>The symptoms of schizophrenia, the truth behind common misconceptions surrounding this illness and the nature and impact of psychosis.</li> <li>How medication and talk-based therapies are used in the treatment and management of mental illness, and why some people with mental illness need to stay in hospital on an inpatient basis.</li> <li>How and why people self-harm, the nature of suicidal thoughts and how to help someone who is contemplating ending their own life.</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits Of Taking This Course:</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>You will be in a position to support those experiencing mental illness or psychological distress, both at home and in the workplace.</li> <li>If you are interested in a career supporting those with psychiatric difficulties, this course will provide you with a useful overview of the most common mental health topics.</li> <li>If you work in an HR or management role, this course will provide you with the skills you need to support employees with mental health problems.</li> <li>If you are interested in psychology, this course will give you an insight into the various forms mental illness can take and how it is treated.</li> <li>This course will provide you with background information that will help you make sense of public policy issues relating to mental health.</li> </ul>  </CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Plant-Based Nutrition</h4> When it comes to losing weight or attaining fitness goals, the food you eat plays a very important role. As a fitness trainer, poor eating choices can hold your clients back from shedding weight or improving their sports performance. Six-packs, abs and strong biceps are first made in the kitchen before they can be developed in the gym.

In addition, many children who are neglected hide it as best they can, especially as they get older, and conditions worsen. Being able to identify the risk factors, signs and symptoms of child neglect can help you keep the children in your life safe. This course goes into detail about child neglect. We begin by talking about the basic forms of neglect, including physical, emotional and educational, and how they manifest. Next, we review the factors that may mean that a child is at a higher risk of being neglected than their peers. A discussion of the warning signs of neglect, including the emotional and behavioural changes that a neglected child may exhibit, follows. Finally, we review the best practices to keep in mind when responding to disclosures, as well as how you can report your concerns to the authorities. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>What the long-term effects of child neglect are</li> <li>How to identify children who are at risk by their behaviour and the situation</li> <li>The factors that impact how a person responds to child neglect</li> <li>The signs and symptoms that mean that you need to examine a child’s situation in closer detail</li> <li>What happens after you report your concerns</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of Taking this Course:</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>Understanding more about the lifelong impact that neglect can have on a child</li> <li>Learning more about the importance of reporting your concerns immediately</li> <li>Understanding how neglect occurs and what the risk factors are</li> <li>Being able to confidently look out for the children in your life whom you care about</li> <li>Learning how to cope with allegations, disclosures and suspicions of neglect</li> </ul></CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy </h4> People with borderline personality disorder struggle with pervasive emotion regulation. They are unable to identify their feelings or emotions, lack the skills they need to manage their emotions and often develop problematic behaviours, such as self-harm, suicidal thoughts and substance abuse to help them cope. Dialectical behaviour therapy was developed to help such people understand the relationship between emotions, thoughts and behaviours. The therapy is based on the notion that changing one of the elements changes the other elements. For instance, changing behaviours also alters related emotions and thoughts, and so on. Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT differs from other psychotherapy treatments in many ways. It looks at the patient holistically, using a custom approach that meets their treatment needs. It assesses how an individual’s mental health impacts their problem and vice versa. This course provides details on everything you need to know about DBT. Firstly, it defines DBT and how it works to help treat various issues related to mental disorders. Next, it covers various components of DBT and what is often involved in treatment. It goes on to discuss the various DBT treatment modules and their main focus. Finally, it states the many benefits of dialectical behaviour therapy. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The meaning of DBT and how it works</li> <li>The difference between DBT and cognitive behavioural therapy or CBT</li> <li>The components of DBT</li> <li>The treatment modules</li> <li>The mental issues that DBT can treat</li> <li>The benefits of DBT in the treatment of complex mental disorders</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of Taking This Course:</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> Taking this course can help you: <li>Determine if you are suffering from a mental disorder</li> <li>Determine if DBT can help you cope with your emotional issues</li> <li>Learn the benefits of DBT as a form of treatment</li> <li>Learn how to set goals and achieve them</li> <li>Develop healthy relationships</li> <li>Get motivated to take a career in DBT to help people coping with emotional distress</li> <li>Improve your quality of life or that of someone close to you</li> <li>Decide to go for DBT therapy to help you overcome trauma</li> </ul> </CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Caring for the Elderly</h4> Elderly care focuses on the elderly’s personal and social needs, including help with health care and daily activities. The elderly desire to age with dignity. Therefore, there is a need for customisation of activities, housing, training of employees and services to suit the specific needs of the elderly. A significant percentage of elderly care worldwide falls under the informal or unpaid market segment. Ageing is inevitable and affects all families. Adults imagining their parents as elderly might not give the right image of how their ageing is bound to affect them. This is more so true if parents are already aged, but still healthy and strong enough to care for themselves.

<CourseDescription><h4>Learning Disabilities Awareness</h4> Learning disabilities are often diagnosed in children after they start school. Although the disorders develop in children at a young age, even before birth, they only manifest in school age children. Affected children are unable to interpret what they see or hear. They are also not able to connect information from various parts of the brain. The problems manifest as difficulties with written or spoken language, self-control, co-ordination or even attention. The difficulties also affect school work and impair learning to write, read or do mathematics. However, an individual’s IQ or the person’s intelligence is not reflected through learning disabilities. The disorders are often lifelong, impacting an individual’s family situation, work or school, friendships, daily routines or even play. Overlapping learning disabilities can become apparent in children with the disorders. However, some children have just one independent learning issue, which has no effect on other parts of their lives. Not all learning difficulties fall under learning disabilities. Some children are just slow to develop specific skills because children naturally differ in their rate of development. Therefore, what may seem to be a learning disorder may just be a delay in reaching maturity. This course covers everything you need to know about learning disabilities. <h4>You Will Learn:</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>What learning disabilities are and how they occur</li> <li>Types of learning disabilities</li> <li>Signs of learning disabilities in children in their early years, their fifth year and at primary school level</li> <li>Signs of learning disabilities in secondary school students and adults</li> <li>Interventions for learning disabilities</li> <li>Learning disability awareness months and weeks</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of Taking This Course</h4> Taking this course will help you: <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>Understand learning disabilities, how they occur and how they manifest</li> <li>Learn the different types of learning disabilities</li> <li>Help create awareness about the learning disabilities</li> <li>Determine if your child has a learning disability</li> <li>Learn how to treat learning disorders</li> </ul></CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Play Therapy</h4> Children can be unable to express themselves using words. They lack the verbal and cognitive skills required to fully express themselves and talk about issues that they face. It becomes even worse if the child is suffering from a mental illness or disorder. For instance, grief or anger is complex. A child may not be able to process the feelings and related thoughts, making it difficult for them to deal with the issues. This is where play therapy comes in. It can help children learn how to deal with mental issues that are causing them distress. Play allows them to act out scenes that are similar to what they may be facing, work on addressing particular issues or even develop characters with similar emotions or feelings as theirs. It is a hands-on therapy. Children can use toys to express their feelings. For example, a child who has lost a parent or a sibling can use puppets to portray a character that misses a friend and feels sad. A dolls’ house can feature a child beneath their bed, hiding from parents who are fighting, to help a child that has experienced domestic violence. A therapist can help during play to solve a problem based on the type of approach that is being implemented. The therapist can also simply observe how the child helps the toy character to overcome its emotions. <h4>You Will Learn</h4> <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The meaning of play therapy; what it is and what is involved</li> <li>About the types of play therapy</li> <li>When to use play therapy</li> <li>The tools and approaches that are often used in play therapy</li> <li>How play therapy works</li> <li>The benefits of play therapy</li> <li>The qualities of a good therapist</li> </ul> <h4>Benefits of Taking This Course</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> Taking the course will help you: <li>Learn the basics of play therapy</li> <li>Learn what play therapy does</li> <li>Learn when to use play therapy and how it works</li> <li>Know the tools and approaches that the therapy uses</li> <li>Learn the benefits of using the therapy</li> <li>Determine if you have any particular interest in learning more about play therapy</li> <li>Determine if you would want to become a play therapist</li> <li>Increase the knowledge you have about psychotherapies </li> </ul></CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Chinese Medicine</h4> As healthcare costs rise and many healthcare facilities become overwhelmed, some people often end up left without treatment options or prefer non-invasive solutions. There is power in taking control over your own health and treatment plans. With Chinese medicine, you can get many treatments that can help reduce inflammation and, in some cases, improve your health and wellness with your doctor’s agreement. The difference between Western medicine and Chinese medicine is complex. Each system has its benefits and drawbacks. People who learn about Chinese medicine often benefit from learning about the different types of naturopathic methods used to treat and care for different conditions.

<CourseDescription><h4>Data Protection Certification</h4> A large organisation is likely to have a dedicated IT department that takes care of all technical aspects of the business, including its data protection.

It is important that there are people within the organisation who understand the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998. This course provides the required learning, to ensure that your company complies with the DPA and collects, uses and manages data accordingly. It is completely up-to-date and includes the changes to the DPA that are coming in 2018. <h4>What is Covered in the Course?</h4> Your team members will study 5 modules that encompass all aspects of the Data Protection Act, as follows: <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The purpose and 8 principles that govern the Data Protection Act;</li> <li>The practical uses of the 8 principles in the Data Protection Act;</li> <li>The role of the Information Commissioner’s Office;</li> <li>The Register of Data Controllers and its purpose;</li> <li>Definitions regarding personal and sensitive data;</li> <li>The conditions regarding how information is used and shared;</li> <li>Regulations and rules surrounding how data is shared within the European Economic Area and globally;</li> <li>The rights of those whose data is shared and how those rights can be exercised;</li> <li>How to respond to the requests of data subjects;</li> <li>The practical uses of the Data Protection Act;</li> <li>Things to consider, when making complaint procedures and policies;</li> <li>What data security is and why it’s so important;</li> <li>What constitutes a data breach and what should be done, in order to handle it;</li> <li>The best ways in which to handle complaints;</li> <li>Exceptions to the principles of the Data Protection Act;</li> <li>Any changes to EU regulations and how they impact British organisations;</li> <li>The potential impact of Brexit changes.</li> </ul> <h4>What are the Benefits of the Course?</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>Certification results in a comprehensive understanding of the provisions of the Data Protection Act and its application to a business;</li> <li>The successful team member will be able to assess the company’s current compliance, identify improvements and implement changes, in accordance with future requirements;</li> <li>Employees are able to flexibly complete the course, in their own time and on any internet-enabled device.</li> </ul></CourseDescription>

<CourseDescription><h4>Reception Skills Certification</h4> The Receptionist plays a vital role in creating a positive first impression in any organisation. Good personal grooming and strong interpersonal skills are two attributes, but this role usually incorporates a number of office functions, requiring knowledge, skills and training. Performed competently, the role often leads to recognition and promotion to positions of greater responsibility. Comprising 17 easy-to-follow modules, the Reception Skills Certification course is designed to cover every aspect of being a receptionist, including the tasks that a receptionist will have to accomplish, dealing with people, the business environment and the importance of superior verbal and written communication skills. <h4>What’s Covered in the Course?</h4> The modules start by identifying the different types of receptionist and how their roles differ. Team members will spend time learning about communication skills, with particular emphasis on the art of talking on the telephone and how to leave messages. Professional and effective communication is a key skill for the receptionist. The competent receptionist will learn how to use a database, as the storage space for the information that they need to keep track of, as well as how to make bookings and reservations (travel, hotel, restaurant, conference, etc.), which usually forms a key part of the job. Good organisational and administrative skills are important aspects, as are the sometimes neglected legal responsibilities of the role – from confidentiality of information to health and safety issues. The receptionist will learn how to run the reception area in a professional manner and how to help their own career to develop, from receptionist to the more responsible administrative positions. The course ends with modules on teamwork – the receptionist cannot perform effectively, without the support of others – and the role of technology, in providing them with the tools that they need, in order to do their job. The team member will learn: <ul class="learn-mod"> <li>The key roles of a receptionist;</li> <li>How to run the reception area;</li> <li>How to effectively communicate;</li> <li>How to deal with administration;</li> <li>How to be a team player;</li> <li>How to use technology to their advantage;</li> <li>How to handle databases;</li> <li>How to make bookings and reservations;</li> <li>Organisational skills.</li> </ul> <h4>What are the Benefits of the Course?</h4> <ul class="learn-benefit"> <li>A competent and professional front-line presence;</li> <li>Easy-to-follow modules, from start to finish;</li> <li>The ability to work through the modules at the learner’s own pace and in the comfort of their home;</li> <li>An industry-recognised certificate, with full online support during the course.</li> </ul></CourseDescription>
